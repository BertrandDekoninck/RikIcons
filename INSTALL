Here are several instructions to use the icons with the Rik gnustep theme.



In the  "common" folder on RikIcons, you will finds icons to replace and complete those found in the "Resource/ThemeImages" folder of the gnustep theme. See https://github.com/AlessandroSangiuliano/rik.theme.

You can build and install  the theme following the GNUstep installation procedure :

you can install the theme  in your local theme folder  with :

"make install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=USER"

or in the system-wide theme folder with :

" make && sudo -E make install"

Check then  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnustep/experience/Theming.html to see how to use the theme.

_____________________________________________________________________________

In the "FileTypes" folders, you will find icons to be put in App bundles or applications' wrappers.Theme engines cannot replace them directly for all gnustep apps.

In the App_Wrappers folder, you will find a set of app_wrappers for nonGNUstep apps, using these icons. Copy these App_wrappers in your local or system-wide "GNUStep/Applications" folder. 
Then run "make_services" in a terminal to update the database of apps in GNUstep.

You can set the app associated with each filetype using the "Tools" inspector in GWorkspace.
For instance, you can select a mp3 file and go to the menu and open the "Tools" inspector and choose VLC as default app for mp3.
 Once your default apps are set for all filetypes, you can relaunch GWorkspace to see it using all the icons of this set.

In the "Places" and "Apps", you will find several icons I made to replace GWorkspace's default ones. This requires for now to subsitute the icons in the sources of GWorkspace or to replace manually the icons in it's bundle folder.


The FileManager.tiff icon can replace the default GWorkspace icon. You can replace this one in the source of GWorkspace and rebuild/reinstall GWorkspace. Or you can replace it in the Resource folder of the GWorkspace bundle.

I've made two icons for the recycler (trash). You can replace GWorkspace's ones in the FSNode folder of Gworkspace source and rebuild/reinstall FSNode. Or you can replace them directly the Ressource folder of FSNode.framework in "GNUstep/Library/Frameworks/" where it is installed in your system.

Note that there is a work in progress in gnustep-gui and gworkspace to address this issue. There won't be any need to patch GWorkspace to use the icons of this set.  So the install instructions WILL change for this. 

Enjoy !
