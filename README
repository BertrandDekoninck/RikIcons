This set of icons, the app-wrappers are to be used in GNUstep with the rik.theme and Sombre.theme. 
See https://github.com/AlessandroSangiuliano/rik.theme.
    https://github.com/BertrandDekoninck/Sombre.theme.

The icons used in rik.theme are the 48x48 tiff files. The SVG ones are the original files I made.
They are released under CreativeCommons (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ or 4.0).


I've created them using exclusively free software : Linux as OS, Inkscape for SVG, Gimp, Pikopixel and LaternaMagica for png/tiff creation, Firefox for web browsing, GNUstep/Gworkspace/Windowmaker for desktop.


Note that the app icons used in the app_wrappers are not my work. I've imported most appicons from the Whitesur icon theme from vinceliuice. See https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme.
