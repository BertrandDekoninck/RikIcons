This set of icons is now part of the rik theme.

All applications icons and fileicons are now included int rik.theme itself and can be used with the latest release of gnustep-gui  (for now 0.25.1).

Appwrappers are intended to launch non-GNUstep applications via GWorkspace - the GNUstep file manager - and to let some filetypes to be associated to these apps in GWorkspace. As any GNUstep application, appwrappers can be put in any folder, for instance your ~/GNUstep/Applications folders.
