This set of icons, the app-wrappers are to be used in GNUstep with the rik.theme. 
See https://github.com/AlessandroSangiuliano/rik.theme.

All icons are 48x48 tiff files. The SVG ones are the original files I made.
They are released under MIT Licence and CreativeCommons (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), except for the GNUstep logo which is CC by/sa/3.0.


I've created them using exclusively free software : Linux as OS, Inkscape for SVG, Gimp for tiff creation, Iceweasel for web browsing, GNUstep/Gworkspace/Windowmaker for desktop.


Note that the app icons used in the app_wrappers are not my work. They almost come from the FaenzaMac icon theme for Gnome and keep their former licence.
